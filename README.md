# house-price
regression problem on advanced housing price dataset

This project is a practice on csv data preprocessing and regression models.
my goal is to get a high position on this competition leaderboard let's say in the top 100.

Practices on:
1. understanding the problem
2. data preprocessing
3. model creation using sklearn

all the information in the notebook

what's next:
clean the notebook dividing it into quick ml workflow, then pre-processing data properly saving it here, then each model in one notebook.
