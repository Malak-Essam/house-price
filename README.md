# house-price
regression problem on advanced housing price dataset

This project is a practice on csv data preprocessing and regression models.
my goal is to get a high position on this competition leaderboard let's say in the top 100.

Practices on:
1. understanding the problem
2. data preprocessing
3. model creation using sklearn

techniques in the notebook:
* Pandas data wrangling.
* Data preprocessing techniques.
* sklearn
* linear regression.
* Random Forest.
* Neural Net.

what's next:
clean the notebook dividing it into quick ml workflow, then pre-processing data properly saving it here, then each model in one notebook.

notebooks
1. simple housing price: i made it after reading chapter 2 from hands on ml book.
